The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors influencing electric vehicle (EV) pricing. The dataset includes a variety of columns that provide detailed information about each vehicle.
The analysis aims to explore how different factors such as model year, location, electric range, and vehicle type impact EV pricing, segmenting the market to identify pricing patterns and premium vehicle characteristics.
Additionally, clustering techniques are used to group vehicles based on similar attributes, allowing for a deeper understanding of price variations across different segments.
